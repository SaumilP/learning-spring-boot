### Multi-Moduled Spring Boot Application
This repository includes different types of modules which are common in enterprise level codebases.
Most of the time, these modules are created from legacy structure and an initial stage moving towards microserivces structure.

### Design Decisions
Most of the time Enterprise level applications includes some sort of modules. Spring boot can also be used to create and configure multimodule projects.
In this example, simple configuration has been displayed. Due to inheritent bug from spring 2.5, `PropertyPlaceholderConfig.java` has been created with `@Order` decorator.
